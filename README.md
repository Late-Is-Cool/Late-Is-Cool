# hi, im late, welcome to my profile

i am a person who programs random stuff when i get the time, well i almost always have time but i choose not to spend it on programming.

i (used to) do web development using sveltekit for a fullstack site, tailwindcss for styling, and typescript for other webby stuff.

im currently learning C++ for game development using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and attempt at porting them to funny thingamajigs like the 3DS, Wii, PS Vita, and other homebrewed systems i have in my possession. including systems that i actually dont own but technically do thanks to backwards compatibility with prior said systems (ex. PSP on PS Vita).

i am still in school and im trying my best to survive my remaining years.

i use <img src="https://github.com/Late-Is-Cool/Late-Is-Cool/assets/78447219/a340dbdc-aadb-4860-a108-1d74814130c0" align="center" alt="windows 10" height="14px"> for development, with WSL of course.
